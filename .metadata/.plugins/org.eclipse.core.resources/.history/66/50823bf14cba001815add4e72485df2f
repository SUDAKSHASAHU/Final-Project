<p>In 1993, our first Fitness First club opened at Jadavpur in the city of joy 'Kolkata', West Bengal, India.
Today we have clubs in 16 different countries, making us a leader in the global fitness industry.
In India we have already opened 7 clubs and moving ahead with opening more clubs in the new future.
We have seen a lot of change in the fitness industry over the years, 
but our philosophy has remained the same: 
to offer the best equipment, range of classes, knowledgeable staff and personal advice in a welcoming environment that 
feeds our motivation of members.
