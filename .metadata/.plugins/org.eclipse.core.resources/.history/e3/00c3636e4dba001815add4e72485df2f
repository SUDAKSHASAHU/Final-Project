<h1>OUR STORY</h1>
<p><b>In 1993, our first Fitness First club opened at Jadavpur in the city of joy 'Kolkata', West Bengal, India.</b>
Today we have clubs in 16 different countries, making us a leader in the global fitness industry.
In India we have already opened 7 clubs and moving ahead with opening more clubs in the new future.
<br><b>We have seen a lot of change in the fitness industry over the years, 
but our philosophy has remained the same: 
to offer the best equipment, range of classes, knowledgeable staff and personal advice in a welcoming environment that 
feeds our motivation of members.</br> </b>
